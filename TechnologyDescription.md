# Technology Description

### Context
> This document will provide a description of technologies and programming languages that we will use for this project. It will specify all languages, the database and possible developing tools that will be used to develop this web application, frontend as well as the backend.

### Back-End
> Below we describe the technologies with which the backend of our application will be built upon. We will provide a more detailed description of each backend service, including documentations of the APIs and database.  We will also create a custom API that will be linked to the database.  We will use the API to submit data into the database and fetch data from the database where appropriate.

### Programming languages
> To develop the back-end of our application, we will be using *Node.js* 16.3.0 with *TypeScript* 4.3.2 . We did our research and came to a conclusion that with the functionality of our application, these technologies will suit our application perfectly.

### Security
> To secure our application we will use Json Web Tokens. It is a convenient way to implement stateless authentication and authorization for our app.

### Database
> Our database of choice is *MongoDB* 4.4.6. We will communicate with it programmatically by using *mongoose* ODM in our back-end.

### Front-End
> To develop our frontend, we decided to use *Angular* Framework together with *HTML*, and *CSS*. We decided to use *Angular* framework because it will provide the user with a convenient experience and accessible interface that has well organised internal structures.
*HTML* technology will be responsible for structuring and placement of the content we want to layout on our web application from the way the data is organised and where it is placed on the page. *HTML* organisation plays an important role in how the user will see our app.
*CSS* technology will be responsible for the representation of the data. For example, the colors, fonts, specifications of specific layouts and background stuff.

### Developing Tools
> To collaborate on the project, share and distribute the code, our team will use *GitHub*. We will use *Visual Studio Code* text editor and its extensions to develop the application. In order to test our Web API's functionality, we will use *Postman* to send HTTP requests and check responses.
