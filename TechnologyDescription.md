# Technology Description

### Context
> This document will provide a description of the technology that we will use for this project. It will provide all the languages, database and possible developing tools that will be used to fully develop this web application from frontend as well as the backend.

### Back-End
> Below we describe the technologies with which the backend of our application will be built upon. We will provide a more detailed description of each backend service, including documentations of the APIs and database.  We will also create a custom API that will be linked to the database.  We will use the API to submit data into the database and fetch data from the database where appropriate.

### Programming languages
> To develop the back-end of our application, we will be using Node.js 16.3.0 with TypeScript 4.3.2 . We did our research and managed to make a conclusion that with the functionality of our application, these programming languages will suit our application perfectly.

### Database
> For the database we will be using MongoDB 4.4.6.

### Front-End
> To develop our frontend, we decided to use Angular Framework together with HTML, and CSS. We decided to use Angular framework because it will provide the user with a convenient experience and accessible interface that has well organised internal structures.
HTML technology will be responsible for structuring and placement of the content we want to layout on our web application from the way the data is organised and where it is placed on the page. HTML organisation plays an important role in how the user will see our app.
CSS technology will be responsible for the representation of the data. Ie the colors, fonts, specifications of specific layouts and background stuff.

### Developing Tools
> This web Application will be developed using Visual Studio Code. We will use Postman to test our custom web API requests. We will also use GitHub to share and distribute our code before we release our application.
