## Merging Process
1. Select a feature that you're going to be working on.
2. Pull the code from Github repository to your local machine to make sure your local repo is up to date.
3. Create a new branch and start developing the feature.
4. Push the code to Github once finished and passed all tests.
5. Make a pull request to merge the feature's branch into the main branch.
6. Once the pull request is successful, delete the feature's branch.
