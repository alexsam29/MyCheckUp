# Overview
Health is a necessity that should be made available to all living things. Today the usage of modern technology and tools is continuously increasing, and the prevention of health issues is seen in most of these technologies we use. Health surveys are commonly conducted in daily human lives and have proven to be reliable. Technology has provided people with the knowledge and power to predict, solve and prevent some of these chronic health issues and saving several lives. With the same idea of improving the health conditions and improve time management, we as young software developers saw a window of opportunity to make use of our expertise in this field. 

# Project Description
We are going to create a web application that will be used by doctors and patients in a doctor’s clinic. This web application will feature an online booking system to book in-person or virtual check-ups, a self-assessment tool for patients, as well as a dashboard for doctors to send prescriptions, appointment notes, and test results to their patients. Our project will also take care of security and privacy issues to safeguard every user’s personal and private information.

The backbone of this application will be the web API that will connect the web application to the database. Potentially, this API can be used by other kinds of client applications such as mobile and desktop apps.

## Features

- Web API 
> A database will be used to hold all the information needed to run the system, such as account information for both patients and doctors, booking times, self-assessment  results, etc. The web API will allow us to get relevant information from the database to use for the web application. The API will also have security features to prevent access to private information and to authorize user logins. 

- Onlline Booking System
> This tool will allow patients to book appointments with their doctor either in-person or virtually. It will show all the available timeslots and the patient will choose their  preferred time and date; patient will be able to request to reschedule meeting or cancel. Also, the doctor on the other end will be able to set available times, cancel meeting  or reschedule and request a meeting if needed.  

- Self-Assessment Tool
> The patient will be able to use this tool to self-assess their current condition or situation if they are feeling ill, to provide more information as a reason for booking an appointment with the doctor. Base on the information provided the system will red-flag their request, base on the number of symptoms that patient might have or critical symptoms might have. 


- Dashboard 
> This window will be the main homepage for a logged in user (Patient or Doctor).  From this page, the Doctor or Patient will be able to navigate the web application according to the options stated in the ProductBacklog.md.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to make health care more **convenient** and **accessible**. This can be achieved by connecting patients with doctors through the internet. A lot of routine operations such as booking appointments, reporting symptoms, getting test results, etc. could be done virtually. Our project provides means to do this and more. There are some applications that are out there doing something similar, but they don’t have most of the feature that we are trying to have with our application. Patients need to use one application to get most tasks done instead of jumping between different apps. This is our challenge to make it **unique** and **simpler** than other apps so everyone can figure it out in no time.
