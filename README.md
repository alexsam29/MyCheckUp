# Project Description
We are going to create a web application that will be used by doctors and patients in a doctor’s clinic. This web application will feature an online booking system to book in-person or virtual check-ups, a self-assessment tool for patients, as well as a dashboard for doctors to send prescriptions, appointment notes, and test results to their patients. Our project will also take care of security and privacy issues to safeguard every user’s personal and private information.

The backbone of this application will be the web API that will connect the web application to the database. Potentially, this API can be used by other kinds of client applications such as mobile and desktop apps.
